### Research interests

Articulatory speech synthesis, physics of voice production - Building a computational vocal tract model for the precise and faster acoustic simulation.

## Education

`Sep2017 - Now`
__MASc, University of British Columbia__, Electrical and Computer Engineering

Supervised By: [Sidney Fels](https://www.ece.ubc.ca/faculty/sid-fels)

`Aug2009 - Jul2013`
__B.E., Institute of Technical Education and Research__, [Electronics and communication engineering](http://www.departments.soa.ac.in/electronics-and-communication-engineering)


## Professional Experience

`Sep2017 - Now`
__Graduate Research Assistant, [HCT lab](https://hct.ece.ubc.ca/)__, Vancouver, Canada

By using finite difference time domain (FDTD) approach, I am currently building a new vocal tract model which is the extension of existing 2D FDTD vocal tract model. The model uses a new geometrical feature (depth) in its acoustic wave solver equation as an extra impedance parameter for a faster and precise acoustic simulation. The scope of this project is to model the acoustics of human voice. For more details please check the [github](https://github.com/Debasishray19/vocaltube-speech-synthesis).

`Jan2014 - Jan2017`
__Software Test Engineer, [TCS](https://www.tcs.com/)__
