### Research interests

Articulatory speech synthesis, physics of voice production - using finite difference (FDTD) technique to build a computational vocal tract for the faster acoustic simulation.

## Education

`Sep2017 - Now`
__MASc, University of British Columbia__, Electrical and Computer Engineering

Supervised By: [Sidney Fels](https://www.ece.ubc.ca/faculty/sid-fels)

`Sep2017 - Now`

## Professional Experience

`Sep2017 - Now`
__Graduate Research Assistant,[HCT lab](https://hct.ece.ubc.ca/)__, Vancouver, Canada

By using finite difference time domain (FDTD) approach, I am currently building a new vocal tract model which is the extension of existing 2D FDTD vocal tract model. The model uses a new geometrical feature (depth) in its acoustic wave solver equation as an extra impedance parameter for a faster acoustic simulation. The scope of this project is to model the acoustics of human voice.
